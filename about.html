          <h2>Agility</h2>
          <p>
            In its simplest form, an agility course consists of a set of
            standard obstacles laid out by a judge in a design of his or her own
            choosing in an area of a specified size. The surface may be of
            grass, dirt, rubber, or special matting. Depending on the type of
            competition, the obstacles may be marked with numbers indicating the
            order in which they must be completed.
